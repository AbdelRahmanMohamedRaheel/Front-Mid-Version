                            Information processing theory is a cognitive psychology theory that studies how the mind acquires, stores, and uses knowledge. It views the human mind as an information processor, similar to a computer, and focuses on the flow of information through stages like encoding, storage, and retrieval.

                            By understanding these processes, we can gain insights into how our minds work and why certain tasks require more effort than others.

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Origins of Information Processing Theory</h2>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            The theory originated with George Miller, a cognitive psychologist known for his work on short-term memory capacity. His paper, “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,” proposed that humans can hold about seven items in short-term memory. Later, Ulric Neisser expanded the theory, suggesting that information is first encoded in the sensory register before moving through processing stages.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            There are three main types of information processing theory:

                        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            <li><strong>Serial Processing Theory</strong>: Information is processed one step at a time in the order it is received.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parallel Processing Theory</strong>: Multiple pieces of information are processed simultaneously.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hierarchical Processing Theory</strong>: Cognitive tasks vary in complexity, with higher-level tasks requiring more complex mental operations.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Driving</strong>: Requires processing multiple sensory inputs simultaneously to make quick decisions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learning a Language</strong>: Involves encoding new words in short-term memory and transferring them to long-term memory through repetition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Problem-Solving</strong>: Often requires breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components.</li>

                            <li><strong>Encoding</strong>: Taking in information from the environment and assigning meaning to it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Holding information temporarily in short-term memory or transferring it to long-term memory.</li>
                            <li><strong>Retrieval</strong>: Accessing stored information for current tasks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transformation</strong>: Organizing or restructuring information to solve problems or make decisions.</li>
