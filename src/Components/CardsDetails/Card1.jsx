                            If you’re someone whose morning routine consists of doomscrolling through TikTok for an hour, you’ve probably come across the viral “red nail theory” trend. According to TikTok creator Robyn Delmonte, who first coined the term, if you sport red nails, you’re guaranteed to capture the attention of a potential suitor. In Delmonte’s experience, every time she wears red nails, a guy comments on it. Since Delmonte’s post went viral, TikTok users have tested the theory and shared their own wins (and losses!). New York City-based TikTok creator, Taylor Donoghue, shared how four men hit on her in public after getting a red manicure two days prior. Similarly, TikTok creator Melisse Martineau said she'd been asked on five or six dates since getting her red manicure two to three weeks ago. Countless other users have also shared how their partners can’t keep their hands off them when they wear red nails and that their partners actually prefer their red manicures to other nail colors.

                            To discover whether or not the red nail theory is legit, we spoke to two relationship experts on the psychological and cultural factors that may contribute to men’s supposed attraction to red nails. We also tapped two nail experts for tips if you want to test out the theory yourself. Below, find everything you’ve ever needed to know about the viral red nail theory.

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Understanding the Red Nail Theory</h2>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            The red nail theory, simply, “suggests that men are more attracted to women who wear red nail polish,” says sex and relationship therapist Dr. Melissa Cook. “Red nail polish suggests confidence, femininity, and sensuality, which can draw more attention from the opposite sex.”

                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            In addition to these psychological factors, there’s also an evolutionary reason why we’re unconsciously drawn to red nails. Although homosapiens have evolved to conceal ovulation, “all other primates have evolved to have a sexual communication system, usually in the form of a swollen vulva with a vibrant red tone,” says relationship expert and psychology professor Dr. Wendy Walsh. In fact, a 1999 study suggests that sexual swellings signal the probability of ovulation in female primates, which they use to manipulate male behavior.

                            Our penchant for red lips, red cheeks, and yes, red nails, may well be an unconscious way to signal fertility.

                            A 2008 study also argues that men’s attraction to the color red has biological roots. The study authors found that men rated women wearing red as more attractive and sexually desirable, and they are seemingly unaware of this unconscious attraction.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            Culturally, red is linked with power, seduction, and femininity, adds Dr. Cook. “These are all traits that could be considered attractive.” In 20th-century Hollywood, red nails and lipstick became a symbol of glamor and a trademark of bold characters, Dr. Cook says. Presently, “red nails continue to be a marker of classic beauty and confidence.”

                            Whether it’s red nails, red lipstick, or a red blouse, research shows that women wearing red get more right swipes on dating apps, says Dr. Walsh. And to increase their attractiveness to potential partners, both men and women tend to wear more red clothing during a first date.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            So if you thought the red nail theory was a fluke, research shows that it’s quite legit. From biology to the influences of Hollywood, there’s no denying the power the color red holds in attracting a potential mate.

                            Sandra Salvatierra, 24, says she's been wearing a pair of red press-on nails for the past week and noticed that both men and women have stopped her on the street to compliment them. “I went on a date recently and the guy immediately commented on them!”

                            Similarly, Lesego Tlhabi, 35, recounts the powerful effect red nails have on her current partner. “I don’t have more men approaching me, but my boyfriend has commented that it’s his absolute favorite of all the manicures I’ve had,” she says. “He thinks it’s very sexy. I don’t know why.”

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">How to Test Out the Red Nail Theory</h2>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            So, you want to test out the red nail theory? Apart from science saying a red manicure will make you instantly more attractive, there’s another reason why you should consider opting for a red polish at your next nail appointment. “Red is classic and elegant,” says Priscilla Nguyen, education supervisor for Aprés Nail. And, “regardless of the season, it’s always on trend,” adds celebrity manicurist and educator Julie Kandalec.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            Consider your skin tone and undertone. When choosing a red nail varnish, it’s important to consider your skin tone and undertone, say the nail experts. If you have fair skin, a blue-based red will work best for you, says Kandalec. While medium to olive tones can pull off a true red beautifully!” For deeper skin tones, consider rich, dark reds like burgundy or brick red.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            Think about the occasion and season. According to Nguyen, different shades of red might work better depending on the season, the event you’re attending, and your attire. “During the summer, bright reds are extremely popular,” she says. While during the colder months, the red shades become more muted.

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Keep in Mind</h2>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            Despite countless research pointing to the validity of the red nail theory, the idea isn’t without its fair share of hiccups.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            For one, while research suggests that women may get more male attention with red nails, it may not necessarily be the type of attention she desires, says Dr. Walsh. As a result, while there are hundreds of videos of people professing their success with the red nail theory, there are those on the opposite side of the spectrum opting out of the trend to avoid getting unwanted attention.

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">The Red Nail Theory Has Its Limitations</h2>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            Moreover, the red nail theory simplifies attraction, says Dr. Cook. “Attraction is complex, varied, and influenced by lots of factors beyond appearance. Focusing solely on red nails can lead to superficial connections and mean that you might be ignoring deeper components of compatibility.”
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            Sure, your fresh red manicure might catch the bait, but a personal connection, authenticity, and charm are what will really hook them in.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            Dr. Cook cautions against following relationship and dating advice from social media trends. “It can create unrealistic expectations and pressures when it comes to relationships, as well as how people should present themselves,” she says. Trends based on appearance, like the red nail theory, can also reinforce superficial standards of attraction and lead some people to prioritize looks over genuine connections, she adds.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            At the end of the day, the red nail theory is not foolproof. There’s no guarantee that you’ll attract someone with red nails, let alone an authentic, mutual connection. With that said, “if you want to attract someone, be sure to dress in a way that reflects your personality and allows you to feel confident,” says Dr. Cook, rather than following a certain color trend that may not reflect who you are or your own unique tastes.
