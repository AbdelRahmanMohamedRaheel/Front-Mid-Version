                            Dependent personality disorder is a Cluster C personality disorder. It is a mental health condition that can cause a person to be overly dependent on other people for their physical and emotional needs.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            People with dependent personality disorder often have trouble making decisions for themselves and feel helpless when they’re alone because they feel incapable of taking care of themselves. They tend to have an overwhelming need for someone else to take care of them instead.

                            The American Psychiatric Association notes that this condition is marked by a pattern of needy, clingy, and submissive behavior, rather than independent or self-sufficient behaviors.
