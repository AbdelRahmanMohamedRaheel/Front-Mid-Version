                            Autonomy involves making independent decisions that align with personal values and goals, free from external coercion. In psychology, autonomy is viewed as a fundamental human need, essential for well-being, motivation, and psychological health.

                            Autonomous behavior is often studied in the context of self-determination theory, which suggests that people have innate psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When these needs are met, individuals experience greater intrinsic motivation, self-esteem, and overall well-being.

                            Autonomous behavior is driven by intrinsic motivation—engaging in activities for personal satisfaction rather than external rewards.

                            Several factors contribute to a person’s sense of autonomy:

                            <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: Understanding one’s emotions, needs, and desires.</li>
                            <li><strong>Locus of control</strong>: Believing that one’s actions influence outcomes.</li>

                            Autonomy develops early in life, with childhood experiences playing a significant role. Supportive environments foster independence, while restrictive ones can lead to self-doubt.
